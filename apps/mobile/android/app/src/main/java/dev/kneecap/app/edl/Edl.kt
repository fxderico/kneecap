/**
 * EDL v1 — the Kotlin mirror of the frozen bridge contract
 * (`packages/editor-core/src/edl/types.ts`, plan §2.3). M9 (this file's
 * consumer is `export/EdlToComposition.kt`).
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS (plan §2.2 / §2.3 rule 1, restated here because
 * it is the single easiest thing for a native mapper to get wrong): every
 * time value is an INTEGER TICK COUNT — `Long`, never `Double` — and every
 * rate is a rational pair of integers. `EdlParser` enforces this by reading
 * every `*Ticks` field with `JSONObject.getLong`, never `getDouble`; there is
 * no float-seconds conversion anywhere in this package.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a 1:1 Kotlin data-class port of every TS field — v1's
 * exit criteria for M9 is filters/transform/opacity/crossfade+wipe-slide
 * transitions/text+sticker overlays/speed (plan §2.3 rule 4), so fields the
 * mapper does not yet consume (masks, keyframe animation curves) are parsed
 * only far enough to detect their presence (`EdlClip.hasMasks`,
 * `EdlClip.hasAnimations`) so `EdlToComposition` can refuse an export that
 * needs them rather than silently dropping them — same posture
 * `validateEdl()` takes on the TS side.
