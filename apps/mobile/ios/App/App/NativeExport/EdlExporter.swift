	///
	/// The volume control reaches 1000% (+20 dB), so the summed mix runs far
	/// past full scale and something has to bring it back. Round 39's
	/// feed-forward version could not: it derived the gain from samples as
	/// they arrived, so on any sudden onset the gain was still ~1 when the
	/// peak went through and a final `min(ceiling, max(-ceiling, …))` clamp
	/// squared the waveform off. Measured offline on synthetic speech boosted
	/// 10x: 46 clipped runs per second, the longest 2.06 ms of flat top —
	/// audible tearing on every syllable, which is what the founder kept
	/// hearing after that "fix". (Its own verification passed because it
	/// counted samples sitting exactly on the ceiling in the DECODED AAC,
	/// where lossy coding moves every sample slightly off that value. Never
	/// measure clipping after a lossy round trip.)
	///
	/// This version delays the audio by the look-ahead window and derives the

	/// that still contains the sample being emitted, so the applied gain is
	/// always <= the gain that sample needs and NO clamp is required. Same
	/// measurement, same signal: 0 clipped runs, peak exactly at the ceiling,
	/// and steady-tone THD 3.0% -> 0.2%.
