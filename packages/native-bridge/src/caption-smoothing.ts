/**
 * Word-timestamp smoothing — plan M10 item 4, corpus `12` §1/§7.
 *
 * "Ship a smoothing pass — this is mandatory, not optional." whisper.cpp's
 * own author documents `--dtw` output as "an estimate of the moment the
 * model decided to output a certain token," not necessarily when it actually
 * occurred in the audio; punctuation "frequently misaligns"; some segments
 * are "completely inaccurate"; and the C++ port lacks OpenAI's own post-DTW
 * corrections (reference Python impl applies extra smoothing the port never
 * ported). Verified firsthand against real whisper.cpp 1.9.2 output on this
 * machine (`whisper-cli -dtw base.en -nfa`, bundled `jfk.wav` sample,
 * `ggml-base.en.bin`) — see `__tests__/fixtures/jfk-dtw-raw.ts` and its
 * header comment for exact provenance and the two concrete defects that run
 * exhibited (a punctuation token whose `t_dtw` collapsed onto the *previous*
 * word's `t_dtw` to the millisecond, and a DTW start that lands inside the
 * *next* token's own coarse window).
 *
 * SOURCE-VERIFIED DESIGN NOTE (not just corpus-derived): whisper.cpp's own
 * `whisper_full_get_token_data()` returns TWO independent timing signals per
 * token, confirmed by reading `src/whisper.cpp` (the DTW backtrace, ~line
 * 9120: `int64_t timestamp = (time_index * 2) + seek; // Each index on DTW
 * result = 20mS audio` — i.e. `t_dtw` is centiseconds, `ms = t_dtw * 10`) and
 * `examples/cli/cli.cpp`'s own karaoke (`-owts`) renderer, which — tellingly
 * — drives its word-highlight video timing off `token.t0`/`token.t1` (the
 * classic decoder-timestamp-token mechanism, coarser but monotonic and
 * segment-bounded by construction) and treats `t_dtw` as a separate,
 * finer-grained *refinement* signal, not the sole source of truth. This
 * module follows that same precedent deliberately: `coarseStartMicros`/
 * `coarseEndMicros` (from `t0`/`t1`) are the reliable envelope; `dtwStartMicros`
 * (from `t_dtw`, when whisper.cpp computed it) refines the start *within*
 * that envelope when it's trustworthy, and is discarded in favor of the
 * coarse value otherwise. This is a stronger, more defensible baseline than
 * trusting raw `t_dtw` outright — which is exactly what the plan's
 * "mandatory smoothing pass" line is asking for.
 *
 * The four required behaviors (plan M10 item 4), each a distinct pipeline
 * stage below:
 *   1. clamp implausible gaps           -> `clampImplausibleGaps`
 *   2. monotonically enforce ordering   -> `enforceMonotonicity`
 *   3. snap punctuation to the          -> `mergePunctuation`
 *      preceding word's end
 *   4. interpolate outliers against     -> `interpolateOutliers`
 *      segment bounds
