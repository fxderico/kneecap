 * backwards-compatible fields may be appended to v1 only if every existing
 * mapper keeps working unchanged; anything else is v2 with a new
 * `edlVersion`. See docs/EDL.md for the compatibility rules and the reasoning
 * behind each design decision here.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS (plan §2.2 / §2.3 rule 1):
 * every time value in this document is an INTEGER TICK COUNT at
 * `meta.ticksPerSecond`, and every rate is a RATIONAL `{numerator,
 * denominator}` of integers. There are no float seconds and no float frame
 * rates anywhere in an EDL. `validateEdl()` enforces this field by field —
 * it is not a convention, it is a checked invariant.
