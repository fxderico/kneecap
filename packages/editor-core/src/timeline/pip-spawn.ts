/**
 * Spawn transform for a duplicated visual element (round 19). Duplicate
 * stacks the copy on a NEW overlay track at the SAME time — with identical
 * params it renders pixel-for-pixel on top of the original, i.e. the
 * founder-reported "preview isn't even doing pic in pic": the copy WAS
 * there, just invisible. CapCut's overlay-add answer: the copy lands
 * visibly as picture-in-picture — video/image at half its current scale,
 * everything nudged off-center — so it is immediately seen and grabbable
 * by the preview's direct-manipulation gesture.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (params in, params out) so it unit-tests
 * without the wasm runtime, same constraint as timeline/transitions.ts.
