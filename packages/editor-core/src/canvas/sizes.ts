 * CapCut-style "original" aspect adoption: the FIRST visual asset imported
 * into a factory-default project decides the canvas aspect ratio, so a
 * portrait phone video gets a portrait canvas instead of being letterboxed
 * into the 1920x1080 default (and exports fill the frame instead of floating
 * in black — the preview/export both render the canvas, so the canvas IS the
 * output shape).
 *
 * Returns the canvas size to adopt, or null when nothing should change:
 *   - the user already made a canvas choice (mode !== "preset", or the size
 *     differs from the untouched factory default) — user intent always wins;
 *   - visual media already existed before this import — the project's aspect
 *     is established by the first visual asset only;
 *   - the imported batch has no video/image with usable dimensions.
 *
 * The adopted size preserves the asset's exact aspect, normalized to the
 * 1080p class (short side 1080, long side capped at 1920 for extreme
 * aspects) with even dimensions — encoder-friendly, and bounded so preview
 * rendering cost does not scale with source resolution (a 4K import must not
 * quadruple every preview frame; export picks its own resolution multiplier
 * in the export sheet).
