/**
 * View-model types for the CapCut-mobile timeline (plan M7). These are
 * deliberately NOT `EdlClip`/`EdlTrack` (packages/editor-core/src/edl/types.ts)
 * and NOT the engine's own `TimelineTrack`/`TimelineElement`
 * (apps/web/src/timeline) — this package must type-check standalone with no
 * dependency on either (see tsconfig.json's `@/*`-scoped-to-src comment,
 * same rule editor-core and native-bridge already follow).
 *
 * A consuming app (apps/web today; apps/mobile's Vite shell eventually) is
 * responsible for mapping its real editor state into this shape. The dev
 * harness at apps/web/src/app/dev/mobile-timeline/page.tsx does this with
 * SYNTHETIC data (packages/mobile-ui/src/timeline/mock-data.ts) — mapping
 * from the real `EditorCore`/`useEditor()` scene graph to this view-model is
 * NOT done this session (see that page's header comment and the M7 handoff).
 *
 * Time fields here are float SECONDS, not integer ticks. This is UI-only
 * layout/interaction math (pixel positions, scroll offsets, drag deltas) —
 * it never crosses the EDL bridge (packages/editor-core/src/edl/types.ts),
 * where the "integer ticks + rational frame rate, never float seconds" rule
 * is a checked invariant (`validateEdl`). A real integration maps a
 * `MediaTime`/tick value to this view-model's `startSec`/`durationSec` at
 * the boundary, once, the same way the existing apps/web/src/timeline
 * desktop UI already does (it also uses float seconds internally, e.g.
 * `timeline/pixel-utils.ts`).
